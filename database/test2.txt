Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a 
piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richar
d McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one 
of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going t
hrough the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable sour
ce. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Ma
lorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a trea
tise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lor
em Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those i
nterested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero ar
e also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the
1914 translation by H. Rackham.
Where can I get some?
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have su
ffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look e
ven slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this t
he first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, 
combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which loo
ks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injec
ted humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
