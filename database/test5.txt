1914 translation by H. Rackham
"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men w
ho are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that a
re bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking fr
om toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing 
prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be 
welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to
the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occu
r that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise 
man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selectio
n: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he end
ures pains to avoid worse pains."
